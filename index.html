        We are a company dedicated to making quality school lockers. <br>
        RIM was founded by Ronin and Inesh, and the namesake is a mix between both of our initials. <br>
        Our lockers are an innovative solution to cheap and spacious lockers for both public and private schools. <br>
        (Totally not a rip-off of IKEA. We didn't become Swedish, I promise). <br>

                    Our current lockers... What can you say? They're small, they're crowded, and small, oh did I already mention that?! <br>
                    <p> These are our current school lockers. <br>
                        as you can see, they are very small and cannot fit anything in them without it being a crammed mess. <br>
                        The length is 33 in, the width is 9 in, and the depth is 11 in.

<p> 
    Our Locker Design from RIM Enterprises is very intuitive, it provides more space for adding your belongings and can easily fit things such as backpacks <br>
    Compared to the other school lockers, our normal locker's dimensions are 4.5 ft tall, 3 feet deep, and 2 ft wide.
    As you can see, our locker design can fit multiple different things in it such as notebooks and folders. It is very spacious and has room for multiple different inserts. <br>
    The budget locker is fit for low budget schools and offices, while the higher end locker is fit for schools or workspaces with a higher budget. <br>
    The low end locker's dimensions are 3 ft high, 1.5 ft wide, and 3 ft deep. The high end locker's dimensions are 5.5 ft tall, 1 ft wide, and 4 ft deep. <br>
    With the above details, you can infer that each locker has its own pros and cons. Our company also provides quality inserts like, hooks, racks,<br>
    and many more sold seperately for maximum profit. We sell our lockers in sets of 50. The normal price per 50 lockers is 6000$ to 6500$.<br>
    The budget price per 50 lockers is 3500$. The premium price per 50 lockers is 15,000.
